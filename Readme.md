# Deno Scripting Template

A template repo for developing scripts with deno. 
These scripts can be compiled to single js files or even bundled with the deno executable for distribution.

This could also be used as a base for a cli written in deno, 
simply use a cli-args parsing package in main.ts and build out the commands.
